# AthenaOne EHR Form Enhancement

## Overview
This project showcases my expertise in biochemistry and healthcare operations, focusing on enhancing the AthenaOne Electronic Health Record (EHR) system at Palmetto Internal Medicine. Recognizing the need for a New Patient Health History form, I engineered a comprehensive solution to streamline patient data collection and enhance document management within the EHR environment.

## Background
As a biochemist and healthcare professional at Palmetto Internal Medicine, I utilized my knowledge in healthcare compliance, HIPAA, and patient data security to develop a critical component of our EHR system. This project was aimed at filling a significant gap in our clinical forms, ensuring a more robust and comprehensive patient data collection framework.

## Technical Expertise Integration
I integrated my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user-centric New Patient Health History form within AthenaOne. This enhancement not only optimizes data collection efficiency but also adheres to strict healthcare compliance standards. The limited JavaScript functionality within AthenaOne posed a challenge; however, I designed the system with the flexibility to incorporate additional JavaScript features in the future.
